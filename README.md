# Bloodeth
Solidity project that I have done during my 5th semester at IIITG.

#### Bloodeth is a decentralised blood donations platform that runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine.

This project was aimed at implementing a blockchain based decentralised web application for blood banks so that the they cannot resort to illicit activities by changing the records. The application is built using Smart Contracts with Solidity and the Smart Contracts can be deployed on Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM). Web3 connects the user interface with the Smart Contracts. This project uses full capabilities of Smart Contracts for the daily operations done by blood banks.
